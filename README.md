# Paxos-Isabelle
A safety proof of Paxos in Isabelle/HOL (should work with Isabelle2019).

This is an old proof of Paxos that I wrote a few years back.
It is based on a [theory of IO-Automata](https://github.com/nano-o/IO-Automata) that is also on github (just put all the files in the same directory and it should work).
